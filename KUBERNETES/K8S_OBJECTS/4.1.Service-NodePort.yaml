# TIP:
# 1. To create 'Service' manifest, remember phrase 'The Service Provider' (T,S,P)
# 2. Add 'type', 'selector' & 'ports' (The Service Provider)
# 3. Here 'port= service-port-no' & 'targetPort= pod-port-no' 
# 4. Don't forget to add the 'selector' to select the relevant labelled 'Deployment'

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    name: my-pod1
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80             #(service-port)

# NOTE:
1. ClusterIP gets automatically created along with 'NodePortâ€™, 
   This is default behaviour & meant is for cluster internal communication
2. Check curl localhost:nodeport must work in your terminal
3. Now open browser & enter EC2-Node-PublicIP:<nodeport-no> & the content must load.

# For Minikube
# To allow networking, open SSH terminal in separate tab & run 'minikube tunnel'
# Then check curl <NodePort-IP> must work in SSH terminal
