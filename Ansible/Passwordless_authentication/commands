# ----------------------------
# PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION
# ----------------------------
# Note: Run below commands in the Master to connect Master with the nodes.
# Please ensure that you have added 'ansadmin' user in the sudoers file (refer initial config file)
# ----------------------------

su ansadmin                                      # switch to the normal user
ssh-keygen                                       # generate ssh keys

# ----------------------------
# Copy the ssh key from master to node
# This will prompt for password for the first time
# Once the ssh keys are copied, you have setup passwordless authentication between master & node
# You can then disable password authentication from ssh configuration file if required
# ----------------------------
ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<node1-private-ip>          # copy ssh keys from master to node  
ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<node2-private-ip>
ssh ansadmin@<node1-private-ip>                  # connect master with the node1
exit                                             # to exit from node1
ssh ansadmin@<node2-private-ip>                  # connect master with the node2

# If you are getting an error 'Permission denied' while running command 'ssh-copy-id', then follow below steps
# Run in Master
su - ansadmin
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub                              # copy the key content

# Go to your Node
su - ansadmin
mkdir -p .ssh && cd .ssh
vi authorized_keys                               # paste the key content from master

# Go to your Master & run below
ssh ansadmin@Node-IP                             # Now you have established passwordless SSH connection with your Master & Node


# ----------------------------
# COMMENTS:
# SSH Key-Based Authentication is more secure and is recommended
# Password-Based Authentication may be used temporarily or as a fallback & is less secure
# Best Practice: Once SSH keys are set up, itâ€™s advisable to disable password authentication to enhance security
