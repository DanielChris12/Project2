# Install Apache using handlers
# Note:
# 1. Handlers are tasks that are triggered only when notified by other tasks.
# 2. They are used for tasks that need to run only if something changes.
# 3. Eg: Restarting a service after a certain task, or starting a service after the service is installed, etc.
